PeanutAI: A Secure and Scalable Trusted Execution Environment.
PeanutAI is an advanced implementation of Trusted Execution Environment, designed to enhance privacy, scalability, and functionality for applications that require high security, particularly in blockchain and decentralized contexts. It extends traditional PeanutAI capabilities by incorporating advanced data context processing, including image understanding and real-time on-chain data retrieval through APIs.

By leveraging PeanutAI, developers can build secure applications that operate within a trusted boundary while accessing more expansive data types and leveraging larger context windows. This README provides an overview of PeanutAI's capabilities, setup instructions, and core features.

Key Features
1. Improved Context Windows
PeanutAI enables larger context windows, allowing applications to handle complex data flows without sacrificing security or speed. This is particularly beneficial for applications in AI, machine learning, and data analytics, where large datasets must be processed efficiently.
Support for both structured (e.g., text) and unstructured (e.g., image) data means that the PeanutAI can handle diverse inputs, opening doors for a broader range of applications.
2. Image Understanding
PeanutAI includes capabilities for image recognition and understanding, a unique advancement within the PeanutAI landscape. By performing visual data analysis within the secure boundary, PeanutAI supports applications that require sensitive or private image processing, such as identity verification, medical imaging, and surveillance.
Through tightly controlled access, applications can use image data to enhance decision-making without compromising user privacy.
3. Real-time On-Chain Data from APIs
Access on-chain data securely in real-time via PeanutAI’s integration with blockchain APIs. This feature is essential for decentralized applications (DApps) and blockchain-based services that need to interact dynamically with on-chain assets and data.
PeanutAI bridges the gap between secure computation and blockchain, making it ideal for applications like financial modeling, automated trading, and real-time analytics within a secure environment.
4. Enhanced Security and Privacy Controls
PeanutAI enforces stringent security protocols to safeguard data within its environment, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential and protected from unauthorized access.
The architecture is optimized for cryptographic operations, secure data transmission, and the ability to handle sensitive computations without exposing data outside the PeanutAI boundary.
Use Cases
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Applications
PeanutAI is optimized for DeFi applications requiring real-time on-chain data, secure trading models, and privacy-centric computations. By using PeanutAI, developers can create DeFi solutions that interact with live blockchain data while protecting user privacy and maintaining security.

AI and Machine Learning
With its enhanced context window capabilities, PeanutAI is suitable for ML models that require large datasets or complex data processing. Its image understanding feature also allows AI applications to incorporate visual data analysis securely, making it ideal for areas such as medical diagnostics and biometric verification.

Privacy-sensitive Applications
PeanutAI’s design allows sensitive applications, such as healthcare, financial services, and identity management, to process private data while maintaining confidentiality. This capability ensures that data handling meets regulatory and privacy standards.

Architecture Overview
PeanutAI is built on a modular architecture that includes the following components:

Data Processor: Enables large context windows for handling complex datasets, supporting both text and image inputs.
On-Chain Data Interface: Integrates with blockchain APIs to retrieve real-time on-chain data securely.
Security Module: Manages encryption, secure data storage, and access control to protect data integrity and confidentiality.
Execution Engine: Optimized for processing large-scale computations securely, including AI and ML model operations.
Each component communicates securely within the PeanutAI boundary, ensuring a streamlined workflow for data-sensitive applications.
